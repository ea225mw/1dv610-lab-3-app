# String Works Editor

## Vision
The idea with String Works Editor is that the user should be able to write or paste a text in a textarea and be able to see statistics about the text in real time, such as shortest and longest words, most frequently used letter and number of words. The editor also offers visualization of these words and letters through color marking in the text.
